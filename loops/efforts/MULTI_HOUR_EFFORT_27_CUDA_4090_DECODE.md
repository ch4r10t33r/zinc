# Effort 27 — CUDA DECODE: close the llama.cpp gap on the RTX 4090 (MoE 31–42%, dense 75–91%)

> **Status:** 🔬 OPEN (spawned 2026-06-14). Runs on the **RTX 4090**
> (`GPU-e59a6fce-1961-bafe-927c-06c0149f2370`). The parallel **Effort-26 BEAT_LLAMA**
> loop owns the **5090** (`GPU-5126d018-…`) + `~/Workspace/zinc-e26` + box dir
> `~/zinc-e26` — do NOT touch them, the main checkout `~/Workspace/zinc`, or push to
> main. Work in THIS worktree + box dir `~/zinc-e27`.
> Forward paths: `src/compute/forward_cuda.zig` (qwen35/36 hybrid-SSM dense + MoE),
> `src/compute/forward_cuda_gemma.zig` (gemma4 dense + MoE), `src/shaders/cuda/kernels.cu`.

## The gap (5090 catalog 2026-06-13, zinc decode as % of llama — same shape on the 4090)
- **gemma-4-26B-A4B MoE — 31%** of llama (47.5 vs ~153) ← worst, the headline lever
- **qwen36-35B-A3B MoE — 42%** (52.9 vs ~126)
- qwen35-9B dense — 75% (120.8 vs ~161)
- gemma-4-31B dense — 82% (46.9 vs ~57)
- qwen36-27B dense — 91% — fine, leave it
4090 decode is **launch/latency-bound** (Effort-25 proved graph replay buys ~8–12% on
small dense; size-gated). llama's years-tuned gathered-expert matvecs lead on MoE.

## ⚡ THE BAR (2026-06-15) — BEAT llama, don't just approach it
Decode is largely CONVERGED: 8 wins on main (C1/C2/C3 + C7/C8/C11 fusions + C17/C19
opt-in). gemma-26b MoE is at its lever CEILING (~63% of llama; ALL matvec levers
REFUTED — float4/dp4a/thread-geometry, see [[project_gemma26b_moe_decode_analysis]])
→ STOP re-grinding gemma-26b. The only realistic BEAT-llama targets left are the
CLOSEST models: **qwen36-27B decode (91% of llama) + qwen35-9B (84-91%)** — push them
OVER 100% via (a) deeper launch-fusion on `forward_cuda.zig` (Effort-23 playbook:
aggregate ≥2 tiny per-token launches per fused kernel to clear the ±1% boost floor),
and (b) LANDING the unmerged `perf/e23-*` dense-decode fusion wins (re-validate +
re-implement on current main — the old cherry-picks conflicted). **Bar = decode tok/s
> llama tg128, A/B on the 4090.** If qwen decode is also tapped, LOG it and stop — do
not invent negative micro-opts. (NOTE 2026-06-15: e26/e28 = prefill on 5090; you own
4090 decode; box wedges → loop runs under `scripts/loop_watchdog.sh`.)

## PRIMARY — MoE decode (the 31–42% gap)
e26/5090 is doing PREFILL (all its cycles so far), so **MoE-decode is unclaimed in
practice — own it here.** Per-token MoE decode = router norm→gate matvec→top-k, then 8
routed-expert matvecs (Q4_K gate/up + Q5_1 down) + Q8_0 shared expert + weighted combine,
per layer (gemma-26b: 30 MoE layers; qwen-35b-a3b: most). Levers:
- **PROFILE FIRST** (util/clock + per-op): launch-bound (many tiny launches/token → GPU
  idles) vs expert-matvec-bound. Let the profile pick the cycle's change.
- **Fuse the per-token expert path** (router+experts+shared+combine = many small
  launches/layer); the Effort-24 batched-prefill expert kernels are twins — the
  single-token decode path may still be launch-heavy.
- **Expert-matvec efficiency**: `dmmv_q4k`/`dmmv_q5_1` for the 8 active experts vs llama's
  gathered-expert matvec (coalescing, dp4a, block size).
- **qwen36 MoE async-pipelining** was a WIN (35b-a3b ~1.5×, branch `perf/moe-async-decode`)
  — check if it's on current main; if not, re-validate + land. **Do NOT async GEMMA decode
  (boost-saturated, proven regression); qwen MoE async is fine.**

## SECONDARY — dense decode fusion (Effort-23 playbook; proven repeatable on this box)
qwen35-9b 75%, gemma-31b 82%. Effort-23 landed 4 stacked dense-decode fusion wins
(V/KV-write, output-scale fold, Q4_K matvec-pair, qkv-norm) on branches **pushed NOT main**
(`perf/e23-*`). Lever: **aggregate ≥2 tiny per-token launches per fused kernel** to clear
this box's ±1% boost floor (single-launch fusions need locked clocks — no
`nvidia-smi -lgc` w/o sudo here). Re-validate + land the unmerged e23 wins on current main
where they still apply, or find new ones. Also: LM-head matvec (vocab×n_embd, biggest
read/token).

## HARD RULES (override the generic playbook)
- **Pin the 4090:** `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-e59a6fce-1961-bafe-927c-06c0149f2370`;
  run validate_catalog + all measurements with `ZINC_GPU=GPU-e59a6fce-1961-bafe-927c-06c0149f2370`.
- **NEVER** touch the 5090 (`GPU-5126d018-…`), `~/Workspace/zinc-e26`, box `~/zinc-e26`,
  the main checkout `~/Workspace/zinc`, or push to main. Box build dir = `~/zinc-e27`
  (rsync source there; never `~/workspace/zinc`).
- Isolated-cache builds (`ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR`+`ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR`; verify the binary
  md5 changed or you measure stale code).
- **Gate:** `scripts/validate_catalog.sh` (ZINC_GPU=4090) MUST stay 5/5 token-correct
  (fused kernels bit-equivalent); if correctness breaks → REVERT + document.
- **Measure interleaved back-to-back A/B** (4090 decode is boost-noisy); compare zinc decode
  tok/s vs the pre-cycle binary AND vs llama on the SAME 4090 + same gguf
  (`~/workspace/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-bench` or the perf suite). Never trust one boosted run.
- **VALIDATED WIN** → commit ONLY that change to `perf/e27-<short-target>`, push (NOT main),
  append a dated cycle-log entry here + to memory. **NEGATIVE** → revert code, log the finding.
- Box gotchas: tok/s prints to STDERR (`2>&1`); `nohup CMD >FILE 2>&1 &` + poll FILE;
  util-gate via `--query-gpu=utilization.gpu`; gemma reloads ~18GB/call.

## CYCLE LOG
- **CYCLE 2 (2026-06-14) — ✅ VALIDATED WIN: capture MoE decode in a CUDA graph → qwen36-35b-a3b decode +62% (branch `perf/e27-moe-cuda-graph` commit `ab01da2c`, based on C1, pushed NOT main).** C1 unlocked this: making every 35b-a3b layer run the async batched-expert path with NO host readback turned the whole MoE decode step into a static stream → graph-capturable. (Effort-25 C4 found the catalog MoE non-capturable precisely because mixed-quant layers fell to a per-slot fallback that synced + read expert ids back mid-block — C1's q5k/q6k experts kernels removed that fallback.) **Change (only `forward_cuda.zig`, +40/−7):** new `moeGraphCapturable()` (true iff every layer's gate/up/down expert tensors have a batched experts kernel), extend the `ZINC_CUDA_GRAPH` setup gate to enable the graph for capturable MoE, and call `moeFfnBlock` (not `ffnBlock`) in `decodeStepGraph`. Kills the per-kernel launch + inter-kernel-bubble latency that left the **boost-STARVED** MoE decode idling between launches (C1 profile: ~18 W / 350 MHz). **Catalog 5/5 token-correct** both plain AND `ZINC_CUDA_GRAPH=1`; the 35b-a3b graph output is **token-identical** to non-graph (40 tokens diffed). **A/B 4090-pinned interleaved, NGEN=160, 5 rounds uncontended, base=C1 binary (no MoE graph, md5 9876dd7c) vs c2-graph (md5 e62a8498):** c2-graph wins **5/5**, ratios 1.822/1.341/1.617/1.511/1.644 → **paired median +62%** (abs medians 61.55→98.51 tok/s). c2-WITHOUT-graph (44.86/40.68) sits in base's boost-noise band (42.82/59.61) → the win is **purely the graph**, non-graph path unchanged. **vs fresh llama-bench tg128 = 106.94 ± 10.74 t/s** on the same 4090+gguf: 35b-a3b decode **40% → ~92% of llama** (the C1 baseline's 134.6 was a higher-boost llama reading; llama itself is boost-noisy here). MoE decode is now near-parity on the 4090. Note: this graph win is the boost-starved-launch-bound lever; gemma-26b MoE is boost-SATURATED so a graph there would likely be a NO-OP (Effort-25 size-gating) — its lever stays matvec-efficiency/fusion. Next: profile whether the dense models (qwen35-9b 75%, gemma-31b 82%) or the gemma-26b matvec path is the higher-EV remaining gap.
- **CYCLE 1 (2026-06-14) — ✅ VALIDATED WIN: all-quant batched MoE experts → qwen36-35b-a3b decode +27% (branch `perf/e27-moe-batched-q6k`, pushed NOT main).** PROFILE FIRST confirmed the lever: 35b-a3b decode is **boost-STARVED** — baseline 39–45 tok/s at SM **~350–450 MHz / 18 W of 450 W** (GPU idling between launches). Root cause: of 40 MoE layers, 35 take the async batched-expert path but **5 fall to the sync per-slot fallback** — gguf scan: `ffn_down_exps` = 36×Q5_K + **4×Q6_K**, `ffn_gate/up_exps` = 39×Q4_K + **1×Q5_K**. The batched gate required exactly Q4_K gate/up + Q5_K down, so the 5 odd-quant layers each did `commitAndWait` + host readback of router ids → 5 GPU drains/token that never let boost ramp (same mechanism as the [[zinc-cuda-backend]] qwen36 async win, just incomplete). **Fix:** new `dmmv_q6k_experts` kernel (Q6_K dequant from `dmmv_q6k_fast` + the `dmmv_q5k_experts` expert-addressing/16-thread-superblock layout) + generalized `moeFfnBlock` dispatch — per-tensor `expertsPipe()` picks q4k/q5k/q6k experts kernel for gate/up/down independently; batched (async, no readback) engages whenever all three have a kernel. Now all 40 layers run async. **Catalog 5/5 token-correct** (35b-a3b 12/12 with the new path; others unchanged; gemma4-31b the documented teacher-forced near-tie). **A/B 4090-pinned, interleaved base(md5 0ec3a9b4)/c1(md5 a7cc3149), NGEN=160, 5 rounds, all uncontended:** c1/base tok/s 44.51/33.44, 54.15/51.86, 57.05/44.95, 61.20/48.10, 47.92/36.33 = **c1 wins 5/5, ratios 1.331/1.044/1.269/1.272/1.319 → paired median +27%** (absolute medians 44.95→54.15, +20%); c1 max-power consistently higher (147–165 W vs 121–155 W = better boost). **vs llama.cpp same 4090+gguf (llama-bench tg128 = 134.6 t/s): 35b-a3b decode 33% → 40% of llama.** Only `forward_cuda.zig` + `kernels.cu` changed (72 insertions). Next MoE lever: the remaining 60% gap is the per-expert matvec efficiency / shared-expert launch count (llama's gathered-expert matvec), or kernel fusion in the now-async path.
